# TreeForTwo's TTT Weapons
A pack of weapons for TTT, and modifications for some vanilla weapons to bring them in line with the new ones.

The design goal of this pack is for every weapon to feel unique. No two weapons should be similar enough that its users can't tell the difference.

## Vanilla changes
* Scout:  
Accuracy when scoped in is significantly increased. Every miss is punishing, so reduce the amount of times it happens by chance. Scoped in viewspeed mostly matches regular viewspeed.
* Shotgun:  
Firerate increased significantly. Accuracy decreased. This is to contrast it to the pump shotgun added in this pack.
* HUGE-249:
Damage increased slightly.
* Knife:
Now one-hit kills again.
* M16:
Scoped in viewspeed mostly matches regular viewspeed.

## New additions
* Famas:
Fast-firing, accurate, low damage, low ammocount.
* Galil:
Slow-firing, inaccurate, very high damage, high ammocount.
* AK-47:
Traitor shop item. Somewhat slow-firing and inaccurate, but very high damage. Limited ammo reserves.

* G3SG1 autosniper:
Sniper rifle with somewhat higher firerate and lower damage. One-shot kills to the head.
* SG 500:
Sniper rifle closer to a DMR. Very high firerate and recoil, low damage. Does not one-shot kill to the head.
* Silenced Scout:
Traitor shop item. Virtually identical to the scout, with the exception of the silencer.

* MP5
Low rate of fire, high damage. Keeps extra headshot damage for longer distances compared to the MAC10.
* P90
High ammo capacity, lower damage output.
* SG 552:
High accuracy, and comes with a scope. Keeps its headshot multiplier at range.
* TMP:
Traitor shop item. Slight improvement over the MAC10. Has a silencer. Limited ammo reserves.

* Pump shotgun
Low rate of fire, high damage. Close to the original shotgun, lower firerate, but more consistent.
